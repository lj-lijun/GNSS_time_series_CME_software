`Updated Description`

**>>> Date: 2025-07-08**

*•	When testing the gCMEbox software package on newer versions of MATLAB, we found that the built-in function juliandate has undergone changes in its input type. To ensure that gCMEbox runs smoothly on MATLAB versions 2022a and above, we have provided an updated installation package **（gCMEbox_v4_2050708.rar）**. We welcome all users to download and install the latest version. Thank you for your valuable feedback — we will continue to improve the software in future updates.

**(Revisions：Xianpeng Huang, Guilin university of technology)**

*•	We have updated the `“Tools”`, **“Hectorformat_tool”** supports to convert the preprocessed data file (eg,“new_sitename_processed.csv”) generated by this software to **NEU format** data; meanwhile, it also provides for the users who need to carry out the noise analysis, and the output of each component corresponding to the **mom format** of the **Hector software** after eliminating the common mode error.*

*•	We have updated the `“Tools”`, the previous version does not support PBO (Plate Boundary Observatory) `pos` files, but now it supports one-click batch conversion of `pos` files.*

*•	We added the corresponding function: `./tool/Read_PBO_Pos.m and PBO_origin_std_pos.m`*

*•	We modified the “PBO_origin_std” GUI as follows, you can choose the input file type: `CSV or POS`.*

**Note: To ensure normal use of the gCMEbox software, we have the following recommendations:**

•	It is recommended to use MATLAB version 2022(a/b) or higher.

•	It is recommended to start the MATLAB software before using the software, as a MATLAB environment is required for gCMEbox to run;

•	It is recommended to open the software catalog through MATLAB.
